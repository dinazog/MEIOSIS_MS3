# MEIOSIS_MS_3: Community Reshuffling Analysis

## üåç **Overview**
This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for **Community Reshuffling Analysis**, exploring how climate change and environmental factors drive shifts in butterfly community composition over time. The analysis leverages the **Community Weighted Length Index (CWLI)** to quantify changes in body size across different monitoring sites, comparing observed trends with null models generated through randomization.

## üìä **Key Features**
- **Community Weighted Length Index (CWLI):** Quantifies butterfly body size shifts over time.
- **Null Model Simulations:** Assesses the significance of observed patterns against randomized expectations.
- **Advanced Statistical Modeling:** Uses linear mixed-effects models and generalized linear models (GLMs).
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Highlights significant changes in community structure.
- **Exportable Outputs:** Structured results for research and conservation policy applications.

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Load Required Libraries**
Import the necessary R packages for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.

### **Step 2: Set Working Directory & Load Data**
- Configure your working directory.
- Load the butterfly dataset, including species information, site locations, wing length measurements, and environmental variables.

### **Step 3: Data Preprocessing**
- Convert categorical variables (e.g., species names, site IDs) into factors.
- Filter out rows with missing values in body size measurements to ensure data consistency.

### **Step 4: Compute Observed CWLI**
- Calculate the CWLI for each site and year by computing the weighted mean of butterfly body sizes, using species abundance as weights.
- This establishes a baseline for comparison with null models.

### **Step 5: Generate Null Distributions**
- Randomize species occurrence data across years to disrupt temporal dependencies while preserving ecological structure.
- Compute CWLI under randomized conditions for each site-year combination.
- Perform 999 iterations to create robust null distributions.

### **Step 6: Compare Observed vs. Null Distributions**
- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of CWLI under the null model.
- Compare observed CWLI with null distributions using Z-scores and p-values.
- Identify statistically significant deviations from expected trends.

### **Step 7: Visualize Results**
- Plot observed CWLI trends over time for each monitoring site.
- Highlight significant deviations from null expectations.
- Use intuitive color coding to distinguish between significant and non-significant trends.

### **Step 8: Fit a Global Mixed-Effects Model**
- Apply a linear mixed-effects model (LME) to assess global CWLI trends while accounting for site-specific variability.
- Include **year** as a fixed effect and **site** as a random effect.

### **Step 9: Community Reshuffling GLM**
- Fit a Poisson GLM to explore the influence of environmental variables (e.g., elevation, species traits) on species abundance.
- Address overdispersion using a Negative Binomial GLM if needed.
- Perform model diagnostics, including residual analysis and multicollinearity checks.

### **Step 10: Save & Export Results**
- Export cleaned datasets and statistical outputs as CSV files.
- Outputs are optimized for further interpretation and integration into conservation strategies.
